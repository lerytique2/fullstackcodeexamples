Spam Check System
Overview
This project provides sample code for a spam checking system, showcasing best practices for front-end, back-end, and database development. The included files are examples of how I would approach my work in these areas. You are welcome to try using these files in your projects, but they require further integration and deployment.

Files
SpamFilter.js: A React component for user input and spam check interaction. It demonstrates the use of React hooks, asynchronous API calls with Axios, and conditional rendering. This approach aligns with modern React development practices, promoting reusability and maintainability.

SpamChecker.php: A PHP file containing a spam check implementation using strategy patterns. It illustrates the use of object-oriented programming, dependency injection, and PSR-3 logging in PHP. This design allows for flexible and testable code, which is crucial for scalable applications.

spam_checks.sql: A SQL file defining the schema for a spam checking database. It showcases the use of indexes for performance optimization and the separation of concerns by having different tables for different types of data. This structure ensures efficient data retrieval and management.

README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage information.

Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Set up a MySQL database and run the spam_checks.sql script to create the necessary tables.
Configure the database connection in the PHP files as needed.
Run the React front-end and PHP back-end on a web server.
Access the React application in a web browser to start checking emails for spam.
Usage
Enter an email address in the input field of the React application and click the "Check" button. The system will send the email to the PHP back-end, which will use the defined spam check strategies to determine if the email is spam. The result will be displayed on the page.

Note
These files are standalone examples and require adjustments and improvements for full integration into a project. They demonstrate the use of specific approaches and technologies that are considered best practices in their respective areas.

This updated README provides a more detailed overview of the project, including the technologies and approaches used in each file, and a note about the need for further integration and improvements.
